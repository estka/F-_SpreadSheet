### Simple SpreadSheet developed in F#

Prerequisites: Have F# and Mono installed.

The assignment can be found in the file `CalcSheetAssignment.pdf`.
My solution can be found in the file `FSharpSample/src/CalcSheetApp/Program.fs`.

To run the code: 

`$ cd into FSharpSample/src/CalcSheetApp/` 

From this directory run 

`$ dotnet build`

`$ dotnet run`

Alternatively run the code from root directory:

`$ dotnet build FSharpSample/FSharpSample.sln`

`$ dotnet run --project FSharpSample/src/CalcSheetApp/CalcSheetApp.fsproj`
